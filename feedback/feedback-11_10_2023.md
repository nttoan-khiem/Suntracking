"This serves to block the solar radiation from one of the two LDRs when the system is not perpendicular to the light ray". There may be wrong, because LDR is not create any solar radiation. it should be "This bar blocks **solar radiation from the sun** to the LDR when the system ....".
## 2. This flowchart is good but it has some problems.
*please look picture on below.*

1. You don't  have to use **execution command block** (orange circle) for compare two LDR because when you use **condition block** (in below) then it already execute comparison command. You can replace that command block with **Read data from LDRs** command block.
2. In embedded system programming you shouldn't use **stop block** because the program never stop if power still on supply. You should use two red arrow in picture to continue read data from LCDs sensor. After a period of time, The angle of the light ray will be changed by the sun. In this case, if your program go to stop, it can not read data from LDR to change angle of system, so your system can't continute tracking the sun.
